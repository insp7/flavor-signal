We ate the beef samosa and it was slightly dry but overall very good.

We know what rogan josh is, and we know what biryani is. Neither of these items meet the description of either dish. The \"biryani\" was especially disheartening, as it appears to have been pilao (albeit pilao in very poor disguise). Ordinary pilao takes much less time to prepare than biryani, and contains a much more subtle flavor profile--but it can still taste good.\n\nThe pilao served by this restaurant, on the other hand, did not have a flavor profile and could be described by many adjectives--but \"good\" would not be one of them.",

My friend pointed out the Butter Chicken but my eye was caught on the Chicken Tikka Masala. I ordered it with some garlic naan and was ecstatic to get to enjoy the dish. My food came out and I finished it in within 10 minutes. It was absolutely phenomenal. The flavor of the Tikka Masala sauce was to die for and the chicken was perfect. I then dipped my garlic naan in the incredible sauce and cleaned my plate with it. Overall it was a wonderful experience and will definitely be coming here again.",
