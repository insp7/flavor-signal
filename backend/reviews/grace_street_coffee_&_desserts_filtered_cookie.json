The dusting of churro powder wasn't overwhelming or too sweet.\n\nThe Cookie Monster shaved ice consisted of a vanilla shaved ice drizzled with chocolate syrup, and had two different toppings: oreo crumbs and mini M&M crushed pieces. The ice cream was a bit harder to scoop into with a spoon without it almost falling over, but a fork worked well to grab the pieces. It was light and fluffy, and went well with the toppings.\n\nService is good, they bring you to the table (if there is one available) and you may need to share the table with another group, but the dishes come out quickly and don't melt right away. Overall a great dessert spot after dinner or a casual date spot.",

    "snippet": "Are you walking around in this debilitating heat and need a cool dessert but want to try something new? Grace Street is THE place to go! Especially, if you have kids - they'll love what this place has to offer.\n\nGet off your train at Penn Station and walk a few blocks to K-town and you'll find this hype-deserving coffee and dessert shop. As soon as you walk into the small lobby, you're given menus and you pay up front. You're given a buzzer and seat yourself in the dining area. It's spacious with many tables, clean and bright. I appreciated that there are a couple of free water stations.\n\nNow, If you're familiar with Asian cultures, you know that each one has a shaved ice dessert to help to beat the heat. Grace Street, has several \"shaved snows\" that give a spin on the original Korean patbingsu dessert. We ordered a couple: The \"O.G\" - black sesame snow (like a lighter, more delicate peanut butter flavor), mochi, red beans, strawberries, condensed milk and misugaru (powdered roasted grains give a nutty, earthy, slightly sweet taste) and the \"Cookie Monster\" -  sweet milk snow, M&Ms, crushed Oreos, dark chocolate drizzle, and whipped cream. I highly recommend both!\n\nWe also ordered tang hulu (chilled, skewered fruits dipped in melted sugar, creating a fun, crackly and refreshing dessert) and a \"flight\" of assorted mochi ice creams.\n\nWhen your buzzer gives you the signal, you go to the bar at the far end of the dining area to pick up your order.\n\nAt first sight, your towering, well-accoutered shaved snows will cause your everyone's eyes to widen and all will exclaim \"ooh\", \"wow\" or \"whoa.\". They really are a spectacle. One snow could be  good for two people... if you really want to share. What's great is that the texture and consistency of the snow is not like Western ice-cream or gelato: although creamy, you can eat a larger volume than ice cream because these shaved snows are lighter and fluffier - you could eat the whole thing if you really wanted. I almost did, but my wife thought otherwise.\n\nEating the tang hulu is fun - bare your teeth and take a big bite! Spread a napkin on the table to catch the large pieces of falling sugar!\n\nSummer of 2024 broke heat records! I don't know if we can alleviate the global temperature but you CAN alleviate your personal temperature (and even your climate-change anxiety) by visiting Grace Street!",
