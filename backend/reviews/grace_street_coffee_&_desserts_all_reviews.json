I stopped by and tried the Matcha Beignets with Matcha Ice Cream and a Lavender Iced Tea-and overall, it was a delightful experience.\n\nThe ordering process is pretty straightforward: you pay at the front counter and then pick up your order from the back of the seating area. Service was fairly quick, and I appreciated how smoothly the system ran even during a busy hour. The space is cozy with a casual vibe, and the washrooms were surprisingly clean-always a bonus in NYC!\n\nNow to the highlight: the matcha beignets. They were freshly made, soft and pillowy on the inside, served hot and generously dusted with powdered sugar and matcha powder. Pairing them with the cold matcha ice cream created a really satisfying contrast-warm and cool, sweet and slightly bitter, crispy and creamy. Easily one of the better matcha dessert combos I’ve had in a while.\n\nThe lavender iced tea, on the other hand, was just average. It had a faint floral note but lacked depth, and for the price, it didn’t feel like anything special. Still, it was refreshing enough as a drink to go along with the dessert.\n\nOverall, I’d definitely recommend this place if you’re looking for a unique dessert stop in Koreatown. I’m already looking forward to trying some of their other menu items the next time I’m in NYC.",

The inside of the cafe is spacious, with plenty of seating, and is very lively.\n\nI've been here on a couple occasions now and have been able to try their matcha bingsoo, black sesame bingsoo, their milk teas, and their boba toast. I truly enjoyed both of their bingsoo, which had a strong matcha and black sesame flavor and a thick, icy texture. Their boba toast was equally as good (if not, better) as the toast was crispy with condensed milk and ice cream as well as fruits. The only thing I wouldn't recommend is their milk teas as they are SUPER sweet and hard to drink. Otherwise, the desserts here are great!",

The matcha ice cream that came with the beignets was absolutely delicious and was not really sweet something that I personally like a lot. Beignets themselves were also super yummy, I ate half of them and I was full! The shaved snow was really big and yummy too. Also there is free water, finally somewhere that you don't have to pay for the essentials. Loved it♡",

It was huge—easily shareable among 2–3 people.\n\nDelicate, refreshing, and a fun mix of textures, though it came with a very real risk of brain freeze if you weren’t careful!

The beignets are perfectly crisped and the matcha properly portioned to balance the earthy and sweet taste.

The place can fit more people now, but it’s now cute and cozy spot for a date.\n\nFood is GREAT!!! It still tastes delicious but I can see it’s changing a bit every time we go there.

We got the Churro Waffles and the Cookie Monster. The Churro Waffles were pretty good, with a nice dip and ice cream served on the side. The dusting of churro powder wasn't overwhelming or too sweet.\n\nThe Cookie Monster shaved ice consisted of a vanilla shaved ice drizzled with chocolate syrup, and had two different toppings: oreo crumbs and mini M&M crushed pieces. The ice cream was a bit harder to scoop into with a spoon without it almost falling over, but a fork worked well to grab the pieces. It was light and fluffy, and went well with the toppings.\n\nService is good, they bring you to the table (if there is one available) and you may need to share the table with another group, but the dishes come out quickly and don't melt right away. Overall a great dessert spot after dinner or a casual date spot.",

They were nice and puffy but soft. Despite the powdered sugar it wasnt sickeningly sweet lol the matcha powder mustve balanced the sweetness. The burnt cheesecake are a must here! Even if its to-go. They are nicely done and so delicious. The hubster loved the original meanwhile I enjoyed the matcha! Would definitely get those again!\n\nFour stars though because i'am a huge Ube lover but the Ube coconut latte just didnt not cut it for me. Not much ube flavor that i was looking for.

    "snippet": "Are you walking around in this debilitating heat and need a cool dessert but want to try something new? Grace Street is THE place to go! Especially, if you have kids - they'll love what this place has to offer.\n\nGet off your train at Penn Station and walk a few blocks to K-town and you'll find this hype-deserving coffee and dessert shop. As soon as you walk into the small lobby, you're given menus and you pay up front. You're given a buzzer and seat yourself in the dining area. It's spacious with many tables, clean and bright. I appreciated that there are a couple of free water stations.\n\nNow, If you're familiar with Asian cultures, you know that each one has a shaved ice dessert to help to beat the heat. Grace Street, has several \"shaved snows\" that give a spin on the original Korean patbingsu dessert. We ordered a couple: The \"O.G\" - black sesame snow (like a lighter, more delicate peanut butter flavor), mochi, red beans, strawberries, condensed milk and misugaru (powdered roasted grains give a nutty, earthy, slightly sweet taste) and the \"Cookie Monster\" -  sweet milk snow, M&Ms, crushed Oreos, dark chocolate drizzle, and whipped cream. I highly recommend both!\n\nWe also ordered tang hulu (chilled, skewered fruits dipped in melted sugar, creating a fun, crackly and refreshing dessert) and a \"flight\" of assorted mochi ice creams.\n\nWhen your buzzer gives you the signal, you go to the bar at the far end of the dining area to pick up your order.\n\nAt first sight, your towering, well-accoutered shaved snows will cause your everyone's eyes to widen and all will exclaim \"ooh\", \"wow\" or \"whoa.\". They really are a spectacle. One snow could be  good for two people... if you really want to share. What's great is that the texture and consistency of the snow is not like Western ice-cream or gelato: although creamy, you can eat a larger volume than ice cream because these shaved snows are lighter and fluffier - you could eat the whole thing if you really wanted.

It was $20 with a $2 tip which I thought was a little pricey. I shared with one other person and we still had  leftover. The shaved ice cream was a little over average. Another friend ordered Nutella Mochi waffle which I didn’t get to try but it looked incredible. Also really big portion so two people can share it.\n\nThey gave us the Ho-Dduks with ice cream on the house which was really nice of them and those were out of this world. They had a creamy hazelnut filling and were warm which paired well with the ice cream. Another friend order the lavender tea which looked delicious and she said it was pretty good.\n\nI got there around 6pm on a Saturday and there was only 4 people ahead of me in line. We ended up leaving at 9pm and there were about 30 people on line but I get the hype.

The cashier accurately told us the original was best- though the matcha flavor was also excellent. It's clearly labelled gluten free along with their tasty nutella mochi waffle. The shaved ice looks great, but this cheesecake was the star. Just get one (or several), it's worth it.\n\nAlso, would recommend going during the daytime to avoid long lines at night.",
