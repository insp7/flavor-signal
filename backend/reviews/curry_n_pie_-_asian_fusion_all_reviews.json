The spice levels were well‑balanced and you could tell everything was made with care.\n\nThe staff were wonderful.

I was craving some indian food so i went down to this place because all the other Indian places in Georgetown seemed sketchy. First glance, the interior isnt too fancy, its a very simple place, and pretty small at that. But its not like it was too run down. A waitress came up to us and we ordered a chicken tikki masala and the mango fizz drink. It was delicious! The masala wasn’t too spicy but it was full of flavor. Usually i dont like carbonated or sweet drinks but the mango fizz wasnt too bubbly and it was naturally sweet. Also the food was brought to us in plastic containers even though we were dining in. They said that they were going through some renovations and that they would remove some of the less popular items from the menu and add asian cuisine, so keep that in mind.",

    "snippet": "Based on high reviews and praise from reddit and google, my fiancee and I decided to give this place a try. We ordered our food through the online website through Curry & Pie assuming that it would be directly with the website to help the restaurant avoid potential fees with uber eats and other food services.\n\nWe placed our order at 6:30 PM and based on the email confirmation from the store, the food was supposed to be ready by 7:04. We arrived to the store at 7:15 giving more than enough time but was told the food was not ready and would be 10 minutes later. I am now sitting in the restaurant waiting on my food for additional 30 minutes and the staff have been avoiding me.\n\nThe first round of food came out but was incomplete. I was told 2 minutes and it took an additional 20 minutes. My order was incomplete and the food is now sitting cold while i wait on my complete order. The staff have made no attempt to rectify the situation and are avoiding others who have ordered online as well. Do not order food from here if you plan on doing a carry out. It seems that dine in experience may be better but with staff on their phone or just avoid customers, not sure how attentive customer service is for dine in customers.\n\nEdit: after getting home to check the final portions/bag of my order, the food was inaccurate and got someone else’s order. On top of that, all the food was cold which is partially due to the 1 hr additional wait for food and it seems that some of the food (pizza) was never fully up to temperature. The pizza is stodgy like a frozen pizza and seems to be made in a rush. The garlic naan I ordered is pretty doughy and seems to be under cooked/baked. The pakora in the corner was deep fried beyond recognition and just taste of oil.",

Curry and Pie is small, but that doesn't infringe on its service or deliciousness. Everything on their menu is scrumptious, whether it is a curry or fusion dish. Their curries tend to be on the sweeter side of things, but you can request varying degrees of spice to diversify the taste. Pictured below are the Malai Kofta and French Fry Chaat dishes they serve, which I would recommend. Hope you enjoy eating here as much as I have.",

    "snippet": "Menu Inaccuracy & Severe Allergic Reaction\n\nThis restaurant is one of my favorite restaurants in the DC area, and I was extremely disappointed by my experience after its renovation when I visited with my partner for his birthday. I've been here many times, always ordering the Chicken Tikka Masala pizza because it's truly one of the best pizzas I've ever had. This was not the case when we visited after their recent renovation. The restaurant has taken a new turn with Korean food on the menu and a cafeteria style atmosphere where you get your utensils, water, and everything. This is absolutely not an issue as they still had my favorite pizza on the menu. The options on the menu for pizza flavors were: Chicken Tikka Masala, Saag Paneer, and Margarita.\n\nI ordered and paid for the pizza up front at the register before sitting down upstairs. The food came quickly but the pizza was entirely different from our usual Chicken Tikka Masala. Without informing anyone of this change, the kitchen served a pizza that had a completely different look and taste (including bell peppers, onions). This was after our experience, but I have since checked other reviews and with friends who ate at the restaurant and ordered the same pizza when they went. The pizza we were served was actually the Chicken Tikka pizza and not the Chicken Tikka Masala pizza. The restaurant has decided to replace the Chicken Tikka Masala pizza with the Chicken Tikka pizza, without telling anyone.\n\nIn any case, we ate the pizza because we wanted to give it a try. Unfortunately, the pizza definitely has a very different set of ingredients from the Chicken Tikka Masala pizza as we both suffered severe allergic reactions to (most likely) nuts in the pizza. My issue with the restaurant is two-fold here: why serve a Chicken Tikka pizza if the menu says Chicken Tikka Masala and why is there no allergy warning for the pizza?\n\nI understand that there is an allergy warning up front at the cash register, but it's clear to me that this warning serves as a catch-all rather than being anything helpful for the restaurant patrons. It would've been helpful if the restaurant marked that there would be nuts in a pizza that 1) is not the correct pizza and 2) definitely has nuts.\n\nAgain, this is one of our favorite places to eat in DC and we were really disappointed by our experience, especially for a birthday. Due to the severe allergic reactions, we were unable to keep the food down and couldn't eat for the rest of the night as well.",

At first, my friend and I were not exactly sure if saag paneer would fuse well with a pizza. We changed our minds once we saw the pictures online. The restaurant is in a great location near the Georgetown campus, and is one of the only Indian restaurants in the area.\n\nWe were very impressed with the food tonight. The saag paneer pizza was amazing! I could easily taste the Italian and the Indian influences in the dish. More importantly, I tasted each cuisine fused together as one meal. I've had Indian food in the United States, India, and in Egypt, as well as Italian food in the United States and in Italy. I can safely say that the saag paneer pizza I had tonight ranks up there with the top Indian and Italian food I have ever head. For ten bucks, you can not only get Washington DC's top cuisine, but the dish will also fill you up really well.\n\nIn addition, we also ordered a Malai Kofta. The malai kofta was very delicious as well, and it is cheaper than the other Indian restaurants nearby (almost all of which have lower ratings than Curry & Pie).\n\nAmazing food overall as well as an excellent ambiance. Curry & Pie fills the culinary needs of groups with both food lovers and picky eaters (and groups with Italian-Indian people). I cannot wait to come back to Washington DC and eat at Curry & Pie again.",
