Their Burnt Basque Cheesecake is the BEST cheesecake you may ever try. We’ve also had the beignets with matcha ice cream and the Ho-Dduk. SO AMAZING. The beignets are perfectly crisped and the matcha properly portioned to balance the earthy and sweet taste. The ho-dduk offers amazing cinnamon fluffy pastries with a sweet and creamy vanilla ice cream. It is perfect for anyone with a sweet tooth.",

I remember the first time I went there like 7 years ago it was cute coffee place with tasty Asian style desserts.\nUnfortunately since then they’ve drastically change the interior and now it looks like Starbucks at best. They also take orders at the front so you need to know what you want before you even sit at the table. I think the reason is either new ownership or greed. The place can fit more people now, but it’s now cute and cozy spot for a date.\n\nFood is GREAT!!! It still tastes delicious but I can see it’s changing a bit every time we go there. Portions got smaller, prices went up of course.\n\nI would recommend this place if you like asian desserts especially shaved ice cream with fruits, but do not expect much from inside :)",

As I waited in line, I couldn't help but drool over the array of pastries and cakes displayed on those menues before me. I decided to go with one piece of everything, including shaved ices. You have to order and pay prior to enter, so make up your mind while waiting.\n\nThe cheesecake is not for everyone though.\n\nThe Lychee ices were great, really big with tons of lychee in it.

It was light and fluffy, and went well with the toppings.\n\nService is good, they bring you to the table (if there is one available) and you may need to share the table with another group, but the dishes come out quickly and don't melt right away.

They are nicely done and so delicious. The hubster loved the original meanwhile I enjoyed the matcha! Would definitely get those again!\n\nFour stars though because i'am a huge Ube lover but the Ube coconut latte just didnt not cut it for me. Not much ube flavor that i was looking for.

    "snippet": "Are you walking around in this debilitating heat and need a cool dessert but want to try something new? Grace Street is THE place to go! Especially, if you have kids - they'll love what this place has to offer.\n\nGet off your train at Penn Station and walk a few blocks to K-town and you'll find this hype-deserving coffee and dessert shop. As soon as you walk into the small lobby, you're given menus and you pay up front. You're given a buzzer and seat yourself in the dining area. It's spacious with many tables, clean and bright. I appreciated that there are a couple of free water stations.\n\nNow, If you're familiar with Asian cultures, you know that each one has a shaved ice dessert to help to beat the heat. Grace Street, has several \"shaved snows\" that give a spin on the original Korean patbingsu dessert. We ordered a couple: The \"O.G\" - black sesame snow (like a lighter, more delicate peanut butter flavor), mochi, red beans, strawberries, condensed milk and misugaru (powdered roasted grains give a nutty, earthy, slightly sweet taste) and the \"Cookie Monster\" -  sweet milk snow, M&Ms, crushed Oreos, dark chocolate drizzle, and whipped cream. I highly recommend both!\n\nWe also ordered tang hulu (chilled, skewered fruits dipped in melted sugar, creating a fun, crackly and refreshing dessert) and a \"flight\" of assorted mochi ice creams.\n\nWhen your buzzer gives you the signal, you go to the bar at the far end of the dining area to pick up your order.\n\nAt first sight, your towering, well-accoutered shaved snows will cause your everyone's eyes to widen and all will exclaim \"ooh\", \"wow\" or \"whoa.\". They really are a spectacle. One snow could be  good for two people... if you really want to share. What's great is that the texture and consistency of the snow is not like Western ice-cream or gelato: although creamy, you can eat a larger volume than ice cream because these shaved snows are lighter and fluffier - you could eat the whole thing if you really wanted. I almost did, but my wife thought otherwise.\n\nEating the tang hulu is fun - bare your teeth and take a big bite! Spread a napkin on the table to catch the large pieces of falling sugar!\n\nSummer of 2024 broke heat records! I don't know if we can alleviate the global temperature but you CAN alleviate your personal temperature (and even your climate-change anxiety) by visiting Grace Street!",
