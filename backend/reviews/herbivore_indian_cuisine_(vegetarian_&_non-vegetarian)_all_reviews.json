I was recommend the restaurant from a clothing store close by. The staff were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable, helping me navigate the extensive menu. The food was outstanding, with dishes like samosas, dal makhani, lamb rogan josh, butter chicken, garlic butter naan and chai tea, showcasing the chef's skill and attention to detail. The prices were very reasonable, especially considering the generous portion sizes. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking an authentic and delicious Indian dining experience in Georgetown D.C.",

The saag, aloo ghobi and khadai Panneer were absolutely perfect taste and spice levels as requested! To top it all is the price; very affordable! Really great tasting food we had and huge appreciation to the chef. Also Atif at the desk was brilliant too! If you’re looking for authentic Indian at an affordable price don’t miss this place",

      "original": "This place feels like home. The aloo gobi was cooked to perfection with fresh, tender veggies, and the tandoori roti was warm and fluffy. I wrapped up with their masala chai, which was just like my mom makes! The staff is so friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. It’s clear they care about both their food and their customers. If you love authentic Indian flavors, this spot should be on your list. Bonus: the restaurant is sparkling clean!"
