The menu was extensive and unique, and everything we ordered was fantastic. The keema-stuffed naan was a particular favorite, as was the creamy and delicious mango lassi.

Not as a ritual we force ourselves to keep, but because it’s the easiest decision we make all year.\n\nThe thing that keeps pulling us back is not just the food, though it’s always excellent. It’s the feeling that nothing has slipped. The service still feels attentive in a human way. The management still seems to care about how the room feels, not just how full it is. The menu still tastes like it’s being cooked by people who haven’t gotten bored.\n\nD.C. is very good at producing restaurants that feel essential for about eighteen months. Rasika West End has been in my personal top five since 2014. That’s nine years of consistency, which is a far harder flex than novelty.\n\nWhen friends visit from out of town and ask where they should go, Rasika is always one of the places I recommend without thinking. It’s safe in the best possible way. You will have a great meal. You will be taken care of. You will understand why it’s lasted.",

The stars of the show for the kids (10, 10, and 12) were the Palak Chaat, Chicken Tikka Masala, Butter Chicken and the Naan.  Now the adults loved it also but the kids were asking for seconds.  Butter Chicken is my daughter's favorite Indian dish.  We appreciated that though it's not on the menu, they made it for her.  Overall the food was exceptional as was the service.  Parking was a little tough so we opted to pay the $15 valet.  Overall it was a great experience and I highly recommend. You would not be disappointed!!!",

Reordered the same items along with a couple others, although the Bhindi masala was decent by itself but not the one I had had before. that was the only disappointment for me. the dal dhungree still amazing and out of this world. I would say this would be one of the best Dal dishes you may have had. you will dream of the flavor and smoothness  even after a couple of days. :-). One new favorite is also  the veg korma. The garlic naans melt in your mouth,  For appetizers their Signature Palak chat but tasted a bit oily for next time I might give it a pass., the fries cauliflower mustard dish was okay. was not a big fan of it. crispy on the outside. with some basic seasoning of Curry leaves and mustard.\nthe Blockbuster appetizer is the paneer Tikka in my opinion, it's a must-have amazing flavors.

Our waiter gave his honest POV for dish recommendations, which I thoroughly appreciated. I just wish that I would have tried the duck dish that he recommended rather than going to my norm. He also was very thoughtful in honoring our friendship day with their unique dessert!\n\nOverall, great experience.

We also tried the eggplant Tawa baingan limited flavor for my taste and like the eggplant a bit more cooked. I tried the snapper rechad, perfectly cooked but red sauce with salad sized shrimp was a bit spicy  for me. Rice was excellent. We also tried the salmon and back cod, excellent reviews and they finished their meal. Also the most tender duck we have ever tried, definitely recommend. Rice pudding was excellent. Cocktails were not as impressive and very expensive wine so beware. Overall it lives up to the hype. But I’m not sure I would go back.",

Shrimp was good but the lobster didn't do justice to the high price. Our chicken kolhapuri and sabudana kofta were ok. Sabudana pakoras were greasy and tasted weird. Saving grace was the dessert - chocolate samosas ( samosa filled with chocolate paired with chocolate ice cream). Overall didn't feel the worth for the money spent.",

The fish chilli garlic and reshmi kebabs were also very good.\n\nThe lamb biryani was disappointing. Even though the lamb was cooked well, the biryani lacked flavor, and the manager was kind enough to take it off our check.\n\nIn the drinks, Sania and Sheela were quite good, but the Asha was forgettable.\n\nIn the desserts, we tried the Gulab Jamun and the Kulfi. Both were average and I wouldn't recommend them.\n\nAll in all, it was a positive experience where the staff was kind and treated hosts with respect, and the food was generally very good. Highly recommend it!\n\nUpdate: Visited again and the food lived up to its reputation. However, the Gulab Jamun continued to disappoint.

I was not warm even with several heaters and kept my winter coat on the entire evening. The patio chairs are so extremely uncomfortable. The table behind us was LOUD and their child was obxious with a VERY loud ipad in his lap and his chair pushed out so far from the table that servers were bumping into my back all night with no apology. One almost tripped trying to avoid the heater, him and I.\n\nI ordered a cocktail and my husband had the punch- both were good but not something we would order again. We decided to order the tasting menu and were overall very satisfied- I requested no chicken due to a intolerance and was given a lamb dish as well as a \"shrimp\" curry. I put quotations around shrimp bc I received one, single shrimp in my bowl. I wouldn't have minded terribly except it was overcooked and not edible with the intestinal tract still attached. My husband and I felt the first 3 dishes were outstanding (sweet potato samosa, some type of pea/potato cracker, and palak chaat). I enjoyed the majority of my entree which was served biriyani style but again wasn't overall impressed with the shrimp (as stated) or lentil dishes. Dessert was wonderful and I enjoyed sampling the 4 items on the plate. I was surprised that our main server didn't ask if we wanted coffee or tea with dessert and never asked if we wanted any additional drinks throughout the evening. The other service staff was prompt, cheerful, and a joy. We would go back but would order off the menu, skip cocktails for wine, and only accept a table indoors.",

I went in with my family for lunch and ordered paneer-mussalam that came with a side of rice and along with that we ordered garlic naan and veg-biryani. Firstly they took 15 mins to take the order and then more than 40 mins to serve the order. The paneer tasted like rubber and the taste of the gravy was bad, they just added too much cream in it. The rice side appeared to be side of another side dish. The naan was the size of a puri and came cold when it reached our table. On top of that we ordered additional dishes as running order which didn’t arrive for half an hour so we had to cancel it as our appetite was done. Overall if you’re looking to enjoy good Indian food this isn’t the place but if you’re looking for a fancy Indian restaurant with an expensive menu then sure give it a try.",

Make sure to get that reservation, they go out super fast! Don't worry about sitting in patio during winter either. It is covered and very comfortably heated. I just love this place and their staff. I wish they open up near my house.\n\nBest Indian food we had in Washington DC. The ambiance, service, quality of food is just chef's kiss perfection. So many food options to try. Best part is that you can get small portions of the main entree as sides. We took small portions of everything so we could try different menu items. The palak (spinach) dish is sooo good that we bought it two days in a row. Even the naan is like a cloud pillowy buttery fresh goodness. A must visit if you are in the area!! We all were happy, blessed, content and well fed humans when we left.",

The servers care about giving you a good experience, and the proactivity in ensuring they take away plates/replenish silverware, etc is great. The food was superb.

The chicken tikka masala was good, but nothing out of the usual from other Indian restaurants, so I would suggest trying other things on the menu. We were celebrating a birthday of my friend and I, and at the end they brought us a special dessert. Thank you!!",

The samosas were also great but were not made the traditional way. They came in the form of wonton pouches. The lamb biryani was just amazing. A must try if you eat meat. We also got paneer tikka, chicken tikka, daal makhni, beetroot and goat cheese tikkis and a few more kebabs. For dessert we got the gulab jamun with cardamom ice cream. The gulab jamuns weren’t warm and fresh. We also got the pistachio and rose cheesecake which had a interesting presentation and tasted really good. If you are looking for some great tasting modern Indian cuisine then this place is a must visit.",

We moved onto the Beetroot Goat Cheese and found it not that great. The Beetroot was the majority of the flavor with a very slight hint of goat cheese flavor. I found that very underwhelming. The next was the truffle dosa. It was average since even a normal size dosa would be almost double this size. I barely tasted the truffle and mostly only tasted the potato filling inside. The main star of the show was definitely the Halibut Kerala Curry. This was almost close to as good as how my girlfriends mom makes her Kerala curry with fish. We were both stunned. The dessert was another amazing experience. I loved the warm black rice with the cardamom flavored ice cream. The silver was unnecessary though, lol.\n\nThe food was overall alright but with a strong finish with this entree and dessert, I will be back to try more in the future.",

The Palak Chaat and Black Cod were exceptional dishes - unique, flavorful, and perfectly prepared and presented. The Chicken Tikka Masala was tasty, but not particularly special. Next time I would order something different. The atmosphere and service were nice. I definitely would go back to have the first two dishes again. I'm still thinking about them!"

    "snippet": "Really superb modern Indian dining experience. Incredibly creative dishes expertly served.\n\nWe started with the assorted papadam with the trio of chutneys (mango, tomato raisin, and eggplant ginger). Standout was the mango with an honorable mention for the tomato raisin. Papadam was perfectly crisp, and well dried so not oily.\n\nNext was the Masala Crab Cake with mustard seeds, curry leaves, tempered mayo). Creamy and well balanced with a sharp hint of mustard, these were soft and indulgent they could have been eaten with a spoon.\n\nThen it was onto the Truffle Dosa with potatoes and truffle shavings. Soft spicy potatoes nestled inside an elegantly folded dosa, and accompanied with a creamy spread that accented each bite perfectly.\n\nFor our entrees, we had the tandoori lamb chops seasoned with mace, cardamom, cashew nuts, and ginger (succulent and extremely flavorful, very tender) and the chicken Tikka masala (the definite standout, it was smokey and creamy and heaven with each bite).  Highly recommend you get a garlic naan to sop up that savory tikka masala sauce!\n\nFor our veggies, we had the small portions of the bhindi mulagapodi (sauteed okra with onions, lentils, and sesame seeds), baingan achari (eggplant with fennel seeds, fenugreek), and zucchini corn peanut poriyal (curry leaves, lentils, and coconut). All were good, but the eggplant achari was by far the best.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the chocolate samosas with chocolate mint ice cream. It was tremendous, and the delicately crisp samosas paired perfectly with the smokey ice cream.\n\nCocktails were fine, my Sania \r(Bourbon, Spiced Pear-infused Honey, \rAllspice Dram, Lime, Fresh Thyme) was a bit too sweet so I didn't finish it but it was worth a try.\n\nService was excellent, from start to finish.",

There are also a lot of options for pescatarians, which you don’t often find at Indian restaurants (usually just shrimp). The red snapper was a decent sized fillet. The halibut, while very good, was a bit small but so good it didn’t bother me much. The palak chaat was awesome and tasted as expected. The sauces that accompanied all of the small plates were great.\n\nMy biggest issue with this place was honestly the portion sizes of the sides and small plates. Rice is cheap..not a huge expense to the restaurant at all.  There might have been 6oz of rice with each dish. The dosas…delicious..but $12 for 2 tiny dosa triangles is ridiculous. It’s lentils and potatoes. Also, the samosas were very good, but again the cost is just not justifiable. The 3 in the container might equate to the size of one regular sized samosa anywhere else.\n\nOverall, the food is was super good and I’m giving it 5 stars on the basis of that. Paying way too much for too little is typical in DC and it has to stop. Hopefully I’m not the first to mention this and some changes are implemented. I’d love to come back.",
